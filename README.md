# flutter_assignment2

A Futter project developed for the module of Advanced App Development in Saxion.

## Requisites

The connection to backend is not yet implemented. Despite that, in following versions the API will be hosted in a server and accesible for the users to use the application without having to worry about the database connection.

For running this application, you will need to have installed Flutter and add it in your path. You will also need JDK and JRE in your enviroment variables.
If there is any problem, run in terminal the command: flutter doctor
When you clone the project, I suggest using VS code and opening the project there. You will need to install the Flutter and Dart extensions.
