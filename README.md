A Futter project developed for the module of Advanced App Development in Saxion.

## Getting Started

The connection to backend is not yet implemented. Despite that, in following versions the API will be hosted in a server and accesible for the users to use the application without having to worry about the database connection.
When you clone the project, if using an IDE you need to select Run in main.dart.
Otherwise, flutter run main.dart in your terminal.

For this, you will need to have installed Flutter and add it in your path.
If there is any problem, run in terminal the command: flutter doctor
